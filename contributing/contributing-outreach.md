# Outreach Team

### Our Mission
We drive the success of Zerobase around the world by cultivating and disseminating key messages to target audiences and partners.
We connect the dots between our technology, healthcare, government, NGOs, and individuals. We build bridges with our messaging.
We create Zerobase advocates that champion our platform in their community and network. We create Zerobase communities to iterate on our product.
We give feedback to the Product and Deployments teams in order to make our platform even more impactful.
We recruit volunteers by giving them the chance to be the difference.
