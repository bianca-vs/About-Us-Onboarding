# Contributing to Zerobase
We're so happy to have you! Where governments are unable or unwilling to adequately test people for CoV-SARS-2, we're here to bridge the
gap by enabling even resource-poor communities to utilize advanced tracing techniques to contain infections. 

You know how every job you've applied to tells you that you'll make an immediate impact? We don't even need to tell you how your
contributions will matter, the value proposition of spending even a few hours contributing to a platform that is saving lives *now* 
speaks for itself. An investment of a few hours of your time will be directly responsible for eliminating days or weeks of unnecessary
human suffering. So let's get to it!

bringing about, **thank you**. 

## What Do I Have To Commit To?
Nothing, unless you want to. While there are positions and resposibilities that will require a consistent commitment of a few hours a 
day, we also have plenty of use for those who can only donate an hour or two of their time per week. We understand that your life is 
busy, and will do everything possible to respect that. If you are interested in taking up a more active leadership role and have the 
time to do so, please reach out to Aron for further instructions (and thank you!).

## Who Do We Need?
Whether it's technical expertise, organization, leadership or just your time, any and all things you can contribute will tangibly 
benefit Zerobase. We need folks of all disciplines and walks of life to make this happen. We are in *particular* need of your help if 
you fall into the categories listed below but this list is not exhaustive; it doesn't matter who you are or what you can do, you can
be a part of this movement. 
If you can't find a niche that feels right, please reach out on 
[Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/necsi-edu/shared_invite/zt-cu5215sg-63h4A7uCy~ehDsrfAIJ~_Q), specifically the #zerobase-volunteers 
channel.

Your team lead is Erik Sogn and your Slack channel is #zerobase-specialteams.

#### Students and Hobbyists
Is your proficiency closer to a "Hello, World!" or beginner level? No worries, your time and attention can still make a big impact.
There's tasks in this project that don't require deep understandings of the languages and platforms in use, such as bolstering
documentation and writing unit tests. But this isn't just a one-way relationship, there's a huge amount for you to gain personally from
working with us. In addition to the invaluable experience gained from working on real, production systems, you'll be immediately 
connected with a large network of highly knowledgable and experienced professionals who you can learn from. 

If you're wondering if this is a good way to learn more about software and programming, ask anyone in this industry if they'd prefer 
hire someone with a year of Comp Sci learning at a university or someone who's worked on a production system for a few months. Spoiler 
alert: they'll always take the real-world experience! There's a reason that there's so many memes out there about entry-level software 
positions requiring you already have been working in software for years; real-world experience is king in this industry.

If you're ready to get started, reach out to of the following people on Slack:
* Erik Sogn (Special Teams Lead)
* Andrew Kaiser

Save lives by bringing about more effective rapid case identification and containment. Whether your expertise is running a gel or running an ICU, your knowledge is needed to help bring this system online quickly and to ensure best clinical utility.

If you're an MD, RN, MPH, biomedical expert, or similar, please reach out on the 
[Zerobase Slack](https://necsi-edu.slack.com/archives/CV57RBU8H), we'd love to have you.
